## 🚨 Important Limitations

From the paper's honest error analysis:

1. **Error Rate**: 56.5% total error rate (21.8% high-severity)
   - Requires human oversight for mission-critical applications
   
2. **Computational Overhead**: 
   - 21% slower inference (2.9s vs 2.4s)
   - 19.5% higher memory (9.8GB vs 8.2GB)
   - 50% longer training time

3. **Causal Preservation**: CPS of 0.51 means 49% of causal chains still lost

4. **Scalability**: Documents >50 pages show 18% ROUGE-L degradation

5. **Coverage**: FIBO has incomplete coverage for:
   - Emerging products (SPACs, crypto derivatives)
   - Post-2023 financial instruments
   - Informal terminology

6. **Regulatory Compliance**: 
   - Self-assessed at 87-93% for GDPR
   - Requires independent legal audit for certification
